### Sfxr Playback Engine for Chroma Framework
Utilizing the flexible audio system of Chroma Engine, it is possible to create audio generators for different audio formats. This project serves as an extension for Chroma Audio System and an example on how to take advantage of the Waveform class.

### Usage
Clone the project and add it as a reference to your project or install the NuGet package `Chroma.Audio.Sfxr`.  
Once done, you can optionally initialize the content importer using `Chroma.Audio.Sfxr.Sfxr.Initialize(Game)` from your game's constructor.
